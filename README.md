## Overview

This project is an **interactive web application** that visually demonstrates core **Data Structures and Algorithms** like:

- Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick)
- Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order)
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra)

> Built to help students, educators, and engineers *see* how algorithms work in real-time.

✅ Step-by-step animation for each algorithm  
✅ Custom input support with instant visualization  
✅ Code + Pseudocode display for learning  
✅ Adjustable speed and size of data  
✅ Modular structure to add new algorithms easily
